                <description>Ahoy! It's ya boi, back for more Tumbled. I know it's been a while, but I've been working on a big update and needed to push something out. Anyway, I've been getting really into really out of date and/or underused technologies, and that brought me to RSS. The syntax is easy, the format is open, and I love me some nano action. Oh, wow, I've typed a lot of text. Well, check out 1.3.0 out on GitHub! Bye!</description>
