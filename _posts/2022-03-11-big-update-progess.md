Work on the big update has been pretty slow. I just got the SusBook running Arch and my code editor working how I like it, and porymap is compiling from source as I'm typing.

I've been hard at work (the day before my birthday, might I add.) transitioning some utils and the web stuff to other repos and getting Tumbled its own ~~group~~ *organization* so I don't have to worry about that anymore. I'm also considering running GitLab's CI builder to deploy both the blog and the new landing page, or I might just end up putting it on a web server somewhere.

See ya!
