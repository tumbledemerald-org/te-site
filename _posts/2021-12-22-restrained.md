As some of you may know, I develop Tumbled entirely using a school-issued Chromebook. Today, as I was opening up [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to get ready for a new nightly, it notified me that it had been
blacklisted, effectively ending my hand-picked nightlies.

With that said, I am now starting a Public Nightlies program for Tumbled. Anyone can contribute a set of files (still the standard `.gba`, `.elf`, and `.map` files, of course.) Then, I will manually audit 
and publish them to GitHub Releases. My friend [creepyguy](https://github.com/creepyguy256) will continue compiling standard nightlies using WSL.

Additionally, if anyone feels pretty enough to contribute an automatic Actions script like [this one](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml), that would be very much appreciated!
